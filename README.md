# Ticket
## The Goal
Ticket is a website with the goal of providing the user with the best hotels and the best priced flights to wherever in the world they choose. Ticket provides the flights to where the user picks by showing them the airline there and back, price, and what airports they will be going to. Ticket shows hotel choices by providing the name, street address, price per night, and rewards they will receive for staying there and more.

## How it's Made
Ticket was built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. With the combined used of the three we were able to construct a functional and aesthetically pleasing website where a user can get information to plan the ideal getaway. Using APIs we have gather the information that the user wants presents the with several choices. Ticket is a free to use service that anyone can use to take the stress and intimidation out of travelling. 

## The History and Future for Ticket
This project was built by Andrew, Erin and Joris for a coding assignment. We are very pleased with how it came out; however, due to time constraints features were left out. Additional features that could be included if time allowed include: warnings when traveling to areas with high cases of COVID-19, filters when viewing hotels in the area, and the creation of additional pages where you can learn more about the project and their creators.
